    "description": "An exploratory analysis of the predictive capacity of Wall Street Journal language attention and sentiment on key market fluctuation indicators. The paper first scraped a vast database of WSJ articles, then built an LDA model for the language used, while using the RoBERTa sentiment transformer to weigh directional attention of topics. Finally a Lasso regression was applied to optimize the bias-variance tradeoff with respect to how many topics to include when predicting movement of market fluctuation indicators.",

    "description": "An investigation of the game-level predictive capacity of intrateam salary dispersion. I utilize NBA salary metrics and scrape NBA game minute logs to create measures of per-minute salary dispersion which is then used to predict game-level outcomes using Random Forests. This is all done as a proxy for the future-looking short-term performance of a firm with respect to within company pay distribution.",
