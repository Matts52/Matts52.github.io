## About the Project

This serves as a revamped personal webpage which is easier to maintain and adds a little more creativity than the previous version of my webpage. Additionally, this revamped version was able to develop my skills in vanilla javascript rather than jumping straight to a framework like Vue.js in my previous webpage.


## Usage

To run this project, set up a localhost serve by whatever is your preferred method. Generally, I just set up a python server with: 

`! python -m server.http 8000`

Upon creating the server, navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
